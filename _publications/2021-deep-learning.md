excerpt: "The ability to predict crop yield is vital for food security worldwide and forecasting crop prices can help farmers avoid price crash. In this work, an investigation of using satellite images and deep learning models to predict crop yields as well as forecasting farmers' prices is conducted. For tractability, dimensionality reduction is achieved by converting the images to histograms representing the pixel frequency. The models tested are LSTM, CNN, CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM ensemble as well as a Gaussian Process added to each for enhanced performance. It is found that the proposed ensemble of CNN-LSTMs is the best in predicting the yearly soybean yields in addition to forecasting the daily strawberry yields and prices. It outperforms models suggested in the literature with an improvement of 31% in terms of average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)."
