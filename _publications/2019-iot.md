excerpt: "Monitoring elderlies living alone has been a rising issue that caregivers are interested in solving since many elderlies are at risk of experiencing a fall. In the absence of urgent help, serious consequences may occur. This paper presents a complete communication system to monitor elderlies by checking their Electrocardiogram (ECG) and accelerometer data through a cloud-based server anytime on a mobile application ensuring that they are unharmed. This has been implemented by having a Multi-core Processing Unit (MPU), acting as a gateway, at the elderly's side monitoring signals coming from a wearable sensing device. It will classify ECG and accelerometer data using Machine Learning algorithms, stream the data upon request, alert caregivers through a mobile application and store the data on the database for further analysis in case of a fall. Fall detection had an accuracy of 95% using Extended Nearest Neighbor (E-NN) learning algorithm."
