Hello! I am an AI Engineer and researcher passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My expertise lies in deep learning, time series forecasting, and computer vision, with experience deploying scalable ML pipelines in both research and production settings.

I hold a Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo, where my graduate research focused on applying deep learning to satellite imagery for agricultural forecasting. Since then, I’ve worked on large-scale traffic monitoring systems, developed real-time tracking solutions, and implemented a variety of AI applications for various projects.

Currently, I’m exploring the intersection of AI and sustainability, especially how machine learning can support clean energy systems, environmental monitoring, and predictive infrastructure. I'm always open to collaboration, research partnerships, and new ideas that push the boundaries of applied AI!

Outside of AI, I enjoy diving into history, playing video games, and exploring new places!
